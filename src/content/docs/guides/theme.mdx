To streamline the theming process, ComposeFlow offers the ability to generate a complete color palette based on a single seed color and a selected palette style.

<Steps>
1. **Click "Update colors" button**
2. **Pick a Seed Color**:
    - Choose a primary color that represents your brand or the desired aesthetic of your app.

        - **Vibrant**: Features bright and vivid colors for a lively appearance.
        - **Expressive**: Offers bold and dynamic colors to make a strong visual impact.
        - **Additional styles as applicable**.

4. **Generate and Review**:
    - Click the **"Generate from Seed"** button to automatically create a harmonious set of theme colors based on your selected seed color and palette style.
