ComposeFlow's **Component System** allows you to create reusable UI elements that can be used across multiple screens and projects. This powerful feature helps you maintain consistency, reduce development time, and create scalable applications.

## Key Features

### Reusable
Create once, use everywhere. Components can be used across multiple screens and projects without rebuilding the same UI patterns.

### Self-Contained
Components include their own layout, styling, and behavior. Everything needed for the component to function is encapsulated within it.

### Customizable
Components accept parameters to vary their appearance and behavior, making them flexible for different use cases.

## Example Use Case: PostCard Component

Consider a **PostCard** component for a social media app that displays user posts:

**Initial Creation**: 
- Create a PostCard component in a LazyColumn for the main feed
- Include user avatar, name, post content, like button, and comment count
- Make it customizable with parameters for user data and post content

:::tip[Before creating a component]
Before creating a component, each Composables within the post card item is considered as single
Composable for each

After creating a component, the item in the main feed screen is treated as a single component

![component after creation in list](/image/component_after_create_in_list.png)
:::

**Reusable Across Screens**:
- **Main Feed**: Display all posts in a scrollable list
- **Search Results**: Show matching posts when users search
- **User Profile**: Display posts from a specific user
- **Saved Posts**: Show bookmarked posts

:::tip[Component library]
After the creation, the list of components are visible in the component tab and can be used in
other places

**Benefits**:
- **Consistency**: All post displays look and behave the same
- **Efficiency**: No need to recreate the post layout for each screen
- **Maintenance**: Updates to PostCard automatically apply everywhere it's used

## Creating Components

### From Existing UI Elements

1. **Design Your UI Pattern**: Create the desired layout (e.g., PostCard with avatar, text, buttons)
2. **Select Elements**: Choose all elements that should be part of the component
3. **Convert to Component**: Right-click and select "Create Component" 
4. **Configure Parameters**: Define which properties should be customizable (user name, post text, etc.)
5. **Save**: The component is now available in your component palette

### Using Components

1. **Access Component Library**: Find your custom components in the left component palette
2. **Drag and Drop**: Place the component on any screen
3. **Customize Instance**: Set parameter values specific to each usage
4. **Bind Data**: Connect component parameters to app state or data sources

## Best Practices

- **Single Purpose**: Each component should have a clear, focused responsibility
- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive names that make the component's purpose obvious
- **Parameter Design**: Make components flexible with well-designed parameters
- **Test Reusability**: Verify components work well in different contexts before finalizing

The Component System enables you to build consistent, maintainable UIs by creating reusable building blocks that can be used throughout your application.
