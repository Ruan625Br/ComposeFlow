# Navigation in ComposeFlow

ComposeFlow provides a built-in navigation system that allows users to move between different screens within your app. The navigation adapts to the size of the screen to optimize the user experience and utilize available screen space effectively.

---

## Adaptive Navigation Appearance

- **Small Screens**:
  - On smaller devices like mobile phones, a **Bottom Navigation** bar appears at the bottom of the screen.
  - This provides easy access to primary destinations with minimal screen space.

- **Medium and Large Screens**:
  - On tablets, desktops, or larger devices, a **Navigation Rail** is displayed on the left side of the app.
  - This layout leverages the additional screen space to offer a more immersive navigation experience.
