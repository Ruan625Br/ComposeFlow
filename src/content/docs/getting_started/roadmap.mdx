## Key Priorities for the Beta Version

As we advance towards the beta release, we are focusing on several key areas to ensure ComposeFlow meets the needs of our users effectively. Below are our top priorities:

### 1. **Firestore Integration**

**Objective:**
Enhance data management by integrating Firestore, enabling users to store and retrieve data seamlessly.

**Features:**

- **Data Storage:**
  Allow users to store various data types directly in Firestore, ensuring scalable and reliable data persistence.

- **State Exposure:**
  Expose Firestore data as states within ComposeFlow, facilitating dynamic and reactive UI updates based on real-time data changes.

- **Security Rules:**
  Implement robust security rules to protect user data and ensure secure access patterns.

### 2. **Streamlined App Creation Workflows Including GitHub Integration**

**Objective:**
Simplify the app development process by integrating GitHub, allowing for better version control and collaboration.

**Features:**

- **GitHub Repository Linking:**
  Enable users to connect their ComposeFlow projects to GitHub repositories, facilitating seamless code synchronization.

- **Automated Deployments:**
  Set up workflows that automatically deploy updates to GitHub, ensuring that the latest changes are always reflected in the repository.

- **Collaboration Tools:**
  Incorporate features that support team collaboration, such as branch management and pull request integrations.

### 3. **Integration with Custom Code**

**Objective:**
Streamline the workflow by allowing easy integration with existing codebases, enabling users to enhance their ComposeFlow projects with custom functionalities alongside building apps from scratch.

**Features:**

- **Custom Code Injection:**
  Provide the ability to inject custom Kotlin or Java code snippets into ComposeFlow projects, allowing for advanced functionalities that go beyond the built-in components.

- **Codebase Importing:**
  Facilitate the import of existing codebases, enabling users to integrate their pre-developed modules and libraries seamlessly.

- **Live Code Editing:**
  Implement live code editing features that let users modify and test custom code within the ComposeFlow environment without the need for external IDEs.

## Future Plans

Beyond the beta version, ComposeFlow aims to introduce a plethora of features and improvements to further empower developers:

- **AI-Powered Development Assistance:**
  Integrate AI tools to provide intelligent code suggestions, error detection, and optimization tips.

- **Custom Animation Support:**
  Enable the creation of custom animations to enhance the visual appeal of apps.

- **Expanded Component Library:**
  Continuously grow the library of pre-built components to cover more use cases and design patterns.
